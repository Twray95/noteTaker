# Note Taker

## Description

This website allows the user to create notes and save them to a server. The user can then pull up notes to main block and then click the "+" button to go back to creating a new note. The user can then delete past notes using the delete button by each past note.

## Usage

To use the website the user must first click the get started button on the home page. This will take them to the notes page. The notes page has a column on the left showing past notes and two text areas. The top text area is where you put the note title, and the bottom is where you put the note content. Once both text areas have text the user can click the save button, their note will be added to the past notes column on the left. The user can select the past notes by clicking on them, it will bring up the note into the right side of the page in uneditable fashion. The user can then click the "+" button in the top left to go back to entering new notes. If the user is done with a note they can be deleted by pressing the red trash can next to the title in the left column.
